outline 
* why does this matter for evaluating syntactic status of pronominal forms? 
* explain morphophonology of pronominal elements
* tone changes
* mostly citing Zylstra to start with 
* comparisons from JMX (audio?)
Notes - 
* Zylstra calls them free/clitic forms in English, independiente/dependiente in Spanish
* What I always learned was proclitics vs. enclitics.  Proclitics are like the ones that go in front, and enclitics are the ones that go at the end.  Dependent/independent refers to the fact that first and second person have actual words as well as enclitics, but no proclitics.
* in Apoala you can put things between a verb and a pronominal element (e.g., -ña) — is that the case in Bajo?
* can we talk about that ñá’à business again? i wasn’t quite sure  I got what you were saying abou tthere being 2 forms
